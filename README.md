## Feedback and Support

If you have any questions, comments, or feature requests for this library,
please use the [GitHub
Discussions](https://github.com/bxparks/AceTime/discussions) for this project.
If you have bug reports, please file a ticket in [GitHub
Issues](https://github.com/bxparks/AceTime/issues). Feature requests should go
into Discussions first because they often have alternative solutions which are
useful to remain visible, instead of disappearing from the default view of the
Issue tracker after the ticket is closed.

Please refrain from emailing me directly unless the content is sensitive. The
problem with email is that I cannot reference the email conversation when other
people ask similar questions later.
